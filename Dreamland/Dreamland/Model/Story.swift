Wearing a black hat, and a black bow tie around his neck, Freddy was ready to spook anyone that comes his way. The animatronic bear was so eager, that he wanted Foxy, Bonnie, and Chica to help him with his spooking. \"Hey guys,\" Freddy said. \"Wanna spook more people?\" Bonnie was the first to answer. \"Sure,\" He said. \"Let's go spook some more people. Like Mike and Jeremy are going to be our only guests!\" \"Oh… I remember when I scared Jeremy to death!\" Chica said. Chica is the only girl of the group. She loves to scare people more than anyone. \"Sure… say that.\" Foxy said. He hated to be in the group so badly. Well, he did cause the Bite Of '87."

But nobody was there. \"Are you sure this is where you wanna go?\" Chica asked. \"Yep.\" Freddy said. \"But, there's nobody here.\" Bonnie said. \"Uh… there is a weird looking person over there.\" Freddy said."
